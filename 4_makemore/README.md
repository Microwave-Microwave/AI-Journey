# AI-Journey / Makemore
This is my most ambitious AI project yet. 

Makemore is language modeling according to the 2003 paper from Bengio. This is an MLP. I made it so you can modify any parameter and it will work. Context window is 5 by default.

Added automatic logging of training data (a graph) and a properties.txt that will save any parameters used by the program so one can replicate previous findings.

I intend to use this as a template for the future.

# AI-Journey / The speled-out intro to language modeling
THe title is quite clear, this is Andrej Karpathy's tutorial series on language modeling. In the first lecture we created a language bigram model and later approximated a propability table to predict the upcoming character of a name, with a context window of 1.

I modified the MLP later to train on the values of the sinus function, it was quite successfull.
